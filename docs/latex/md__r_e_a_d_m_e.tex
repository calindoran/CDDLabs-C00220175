These labs are all done in C++ demonstrating different exercises with multi-\/threading programming. In each file has Doxygen code for clear documentation. Each file has their own makefile for compiling.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysection{Make file}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md1}
You can compile each lab by typing in to the terminal in the working directory, \textquotesingle{}make -\/k\textquotesingle{}. This will compile the code and create and executable.

If you type \textquotesingle{}make C\+L\+E\+AN\textquotesingle{} in to the terminal, the make file will remove all of the object files in the folder.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysection{To run}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md2}
After the executable is created, type \char`\"{}./\char`\"{} + the executable file name to run the program.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md3}{}\doxysection{Create Doxygen}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md3}
First you need to open the Doxyfile and edit O\+U\+T\+P\+U\+T\+\_\+\+D\+I\+R\+E\+C\+T\+O\+RY to the working directory + \char`\"{}/docs\char`\"{} (i.\+e /home/user/\+Desktop)

and then I\+N\+P\+UT to the working directory (i.\+e /home/user/\+Desktop)

If you type \textquotesingle{}make D\+OC\textquotesingle{} in a terminal in the working directory, the make file will compile the Doxygen code and it will display the Doxygen via Mozilla Firefox.
